* **Empathy and Support:** Create a safe and supportive environment where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. Show genuine care and concern for their well-being.

* **Collaboration:** Work collaboratively with the student to develop a plan that aligns with their academic and personal goals.  Avoid imposing your own ideas.

* **Clear Communication:**  Explain policies, procedures, and expectations clearly and concisely.  Use language that the student can easily understand.

* **Goal Setting:** Help students define clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.

* **Resourcefulness:** Be aware of and able to connect students with relevant resources, such as tutoring services, financial aid, mental health services, and career counseling.

* **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular meetings to monitor progress, address challenges, and provide ongoing support.

* **Documentation:** Maintain accurate and thorough records of advising sessions and agreements.

* **Confidentiality:**  Respect student confidentiality and only share information with authorized individuals.

troy,238,39,F1338602480840IOXXIK,2025-03-11T22:19:54.600000Z,"Cooking bacon in the microwave isn't ideal for achieving perfectly crispy bacon, but it's a quick method.  Here's a common approach:

* **Arrange:** Lay bacon slices in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate lined with paper towels.  Don't overlap them.
* **Cook:** Microwave on high for 1-2 minutes, then check for doneness.  Continue microwaving in 30-second intervals until bacon reaches your desired crispness.  Cooking times vary depending on your microwave's power and the thickness of the bacon.
* **Drain:** Remove the bacon and place it on a fresh paper towel to drain excess grease.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Uneven Cooking:** Microwave cooking can result in unevenly cooked bacon. Some pieces may be crispier than others.
* **Safety:**  Be careful when handling hot bacon and grease.
* **Alternative:** For best results, consider pan-frying or baking your bacon.


This method is more of a convenience than a way to get perfectly crispy bacon.  Experiment to find the cooking time that works best for your microwave.",OPEN_DOMAIN,False,CHATBOT
