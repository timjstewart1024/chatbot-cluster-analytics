emily,6,2,F1618441264568N5OYFW,2024-10-10T19:17:56.985000Z,"Schools can configure their SSO in QA by following these general steps:

1. **Choose an SSO provider:** There are many SSO providers available, such as Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace. Schools should choose a provider that meets their specific needs and budget.
2. **Set up the SSO provider:** Schools will need to create an account with the SSO provider and configure it to work with their school's identity management system.
3. **Configure the applications:** Schools will need to configure each application that they want to integrate with SSO. This includes setting up the application's settings within the SSO provider and configuring the application to use SSO.
4. **Test the SSO integration:** Schools should thoroughly test the SSO integration to ensure that it is working properly. This includes testing the login process, single sign-on functionality, and user access permissions.

**Here are some specific considerations for configuring SSO in QA:**

* **Use a separate QA environment:** Schools should create a separate QA environment for testing SSO. This will help to prevent any disruptions to the production environment.
* **Use test data:** Schools should use test data to test SSO. This data should be realistic but should not contain any sensitive information.
* **Test different user scenarios:** Schools should test SSO with different user scenarios, such as new users, existing users, and users with different roles.
* **Document the configuration:** Schools should document the SSO configuration process. This will help to ensure that the configuration can be easily replicated in the future.

By following these steps, schools can successfully configure their SSO in QA.",OPEN_DOMAIN,False,CHATBOT

It's essentially the opposite of provisioning, which is the process of setting up and granting access to these resources.

Deprovisioning can be done for various reasons, including:

* **Termination of employment:** When an employee leaves a company, their access to company resources needs to be revoked.
* **Project completion:** Once a project is finished, the resources allocated to it might be no longer needed.
* **Security reasons:** If a user's account is compromised or their access is deemed a security risk, their access might be removed.
* **Cost optimization:** Deprovisioning unused resources can save money on licensing fees, hardware maintenance, and other expenses.

The process of deprovisioning can vary depending on the specific resources involved and the organization's policies. It often involves:

* **Removing user accounts:** Deactivating user accounts from systems and applications.
* **Revoking access permissions:** Removing access to files, databases, or other resources.
* **Disabling hardware:** Removing devices from the network or physically removing them.
* **Deleting data:** Erasing data that is no longer needed.

**Visual Elements:**

*   Use a clear, recognizable avatar (96x96 px, USU Sky Blue background, simple white icon) and banner (704x192 px, representing the university and group; use the USU PhotoShelter Public Gallery).  Get approval from the MyUSU Coordinator for custom avatars.
*   Maintain visual consistency with your brand.  Ensure images are high-quality and appropriately cropped.

**Group Information:**

*   Use the full name of your department, organization, or program for your group name. Include the acronym in parentheses if applicable.  Do not include ""Utah State University"" or ""USU"" unless it's part of the official name.
*   Write a concise group description (four lines maximum initially) that clearly states your group's purpose, mission, services, and how users can benefit.  Mention any affiliations with larger USU units.
*   Provide complete and regularly monitored contact information (email, website, location, phone number). Use a link in bio tool to connect to multiple touchpoints.
*   Use relevant labels to improve search results. Contact the MyUSU Coordinator to add new labels.
*   Set your group privacy (public or private) and adjust full privacy settings by contacting the MyUSU Coordinator.

**Advanced Settings:**

*   Choose a default tab (Discussion, Events, Resources, or a custom page) that best highlights your group's information.
*   Decide who can post, comment, join/leave, create events, and manage resources.  The guide recommends Admin-only control for most of these for initial setup.  Consider post approval to maintain quality.
*   Enable the welcome notification feature to greet new members.
*   If applicable, enable Events, Files, and Pages tabs.

**Group Resources:**

*   Organize your resources using folders.
*   Use the edit function to add descriptions to files and links.
*   Pin important resources for easy access.

**Group Page:**

*   Enable the group page in Advanced Settings.
*   Choose a clear icon and name for your page.
*   Use formatting tools to create a well-organized and informative page.

**Content Strategy:**

*   Define who can post (admins, members, or everyone) and consider post approval to maintain quality and avoid spam.
*   Focus on relevant, engaging content.
*   Use high-quality images (1024x400 px or 1024x768 px recommended) in your posts.
*   Post consistently during peak times (10 AM-1 PM, Monday and Tuesday) to maximize visibility.

* **If you're already a Zoom customer:**  Your existing Zoom account administrator or IT department will handle license requests and upgrades.  Contact them directly.

* **If you're a new customer:**  Go to the official Zoom website (zoom.us).  Look for options like ""Pricing,"" ""Plans,"" or ""Buy.""  This will guide you through selecting a plan and purchasing licenses. You may need to contact Zoom sales directly for larger organizations or enterprise solutions.

* **If you have a specific form:**  If your organization uses a specific internal form (like the one mentioned earlier), use that.

In short, there's no single ""request a Zoom license"" page.  The process is tailored to the context of your organization and Zoom account status.",SOURCED,False,CHATBOT

College-managed email distribution lists are moderated to ensure appropriate use.  The policy aims to prevent resource consumption, inbox clutter, and the spread of disrespectful or discriminatory messages.

Mass emails are defined as unsolicited messages sent to a group of unrelated campus email addresses (e.g., all faculty or all students).  Sending messages to pre-approved groups (clubs, committees) is acceptable if relevant to their work.

Moderation is handled by designated list moderators (e.g., Provost's Office for faculty, President's Office/HR for staff).  Messages are reviewed within 24 hours (or by the next business day if sent on Friday).  Appeals are allowed within one business day of notification.  Exceptions to moderation include messages from Public Safety, WC Response, and the Office of Information Technology (OIT).

Acceptable uses include messages relevant to College business, policy changes, time-sensitive issues, urgent announcements, and event promotions (though alternative communication methods are encouraged for non-urgent events).

Inappropriate uses include personal messages, commercial solicitations (except those supporting College business), messages of limited interest, using ""Reply All"" inappropriately, and any messages violating College conduct policies (disrespect, harassment, discrimination).",SOURCED,False,CHATBOT

emily,604,136,F224015729101BSK4RM,2025-03-11T19:19:10.261000Z,"St. John's Wort ( *Hypericum perforatum*) is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to treat mild to moderate depression.  However, it's crucial to understand that:

* **It's not a replacement for prescribed medication:**  St. John's Wort should not be used as a substitute for antidepressants prescribed by a doctor, especially for moderate to severe depression.  It's important to discuss any herbal remedies with your doctor or psychiatrist before using them, especially if you're already taking other medications.

* **It can interact with other drugs:** St. John's Wort is known to interact with a wide range of medications, including birth control pills, blood thinners, and many antidepressants.  These interactions can significantly reduce the effectiveness of these medications or increase the risk of side effects.

* **It has potential side effects:**  While generally considered safe for many people, St. John's Wort can cause side effects such as digestive upset, skin sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), and fatigue.

* **Quality and standardization vary:**  The quality and concentration of active compounds in St. John's Wort supplements can vary significantly between brands.  This makes it difficult to determine the effective dose.


**In short:** While St. John's Wort has been used for centuries, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before using it, particularly if you are taking other medications or have any underlying health conditions. They can help you determine if it's appropriate for you and assess potential risks and interactions.  They can also help you determine the appropriate dosage and quality of the supplement.",OPEN_DOMAIN,False,CHATBOT
