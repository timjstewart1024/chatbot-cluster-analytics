community,10,3,F947072124676Y4TKF2,2024-11-20T04:26:06.119000Z,"A `jsDataStreamCreator` is a type of Flow processor in Scala that allows you to define custom logic for generating data streams using JavaScript code. It's like a mini-program within your Flow that can manipulate data and return it as a stream.  Here's a breakdown of what it does and how it works:  **Purpose:**  - **Custom Data Generation:**  `jsDataStreamCreators` are designed to create data streams from scratch, based on your own JavaScript logic. This is useful when you need to:     - Generate data dynamically based on conditions or external factors.     - Transform existing data into a new format.     - Create data from scratch based on calculations or algorithms.  **Structure:**  - **JavaScript Code:** You write JavaScript code inside the `jsFunc` property of the `jsDataStreamCreator`. This code defines how the data stream is generated. - **Return Value:**  The JavaScript code must return an array of `SimpleData` objects, `SimpleStringData` objects, or a combination of both.   **Example:**  Let's say you want to create a data stream containing a list of user emails. You could use a `jsDataStreamCreator` with the following JavaScript code:  ```javascript var emails = [""julie@pathify.com"", ""john@pathify.com"", ""mary@pathify.com""]; return emails.map(function(email) {     return new code_data_SimpleStringData(email); }); ```  **Key Points:**  - **Strongly Typed:**  Remember that Scala is strongly typed, so you need to be explicit about the data types you're returning.  `SimpleStringData` is used for strings, and `SimpleData` is used for objects. - **Data Stream:** The `jsDataStreamCreator` outputs a data stream, which can then be processed by other Flow processors.  **In summary:** `jsDataStreamCreators` provide a flexible way to create data streams in Flow using JavaScript. They're powerful for generating custom data, transforming data, and injecting data into your Flow based on your own logic.",SOURCED,False,CHATBOT,[]

community,12,3,F9470721258771LCMKA,2024-11-20T04:28:15.942000Z,"You're right to focus on `jsDataStreamCreator`! It's a powerful tool for generating data within Flow, and it's essential to understand how it works. Here's a more detailed explanation, building on what we discussed:  **Understanding the Basics**  - **JavaScript Flexibility:**  `jsDataStreamCreator` leverages the power of JavaScript to define your data generation logic. This means you can write code that's familiar to many developers and use a wide range of JavaScript functions and libraries. - **Data as a Stream:**  Flow processes data as a stream.  Think of it like a conveyor belt where data items are continuously processed and passed along.  `jsDataStreamCreator` is responsible for creating the initial items on this belt. - **Data Types:**  Flow uses specific data types for its stream. The most common ones you'll work with in `jsDataStreamCreator` are:     - **`SimpleStringData`:**  Used for strings (text).     - **`SimpleData`:**  Used for objects (JSON-like data).  **How it Works**  1. **Configuration:** You create a `jsDataStreamCreator` with a `config` object. This object typically includes:     - **`jsFunc`:** This is where you write your JavaScript code to generate the data stream.     - **`className`:** This is the name of the processor. It's a convention to use a descriptive name.     - **Other Optional Properties:**  You can add other properties to the `config` object, such as `parallelism` for controlling how many data items are processed concurrently.  2. **JavaScript Code:**  Within the `jsFunc` property, you write your JavaScript code. This code must return an array of `SimpleStringData` or `SimpleData` objects, or a combination of both.   3. **Data Stream Generation:** When the `jsDataStreamCreator` is executed, it runs your JavaScript code. The code generates the data stream, and each item in the array is passed along the Flow pipeline.  **Example: Generating User Data**  ```javascript let users = [     { name: ""Julie"", email: ""julie@pathify.com"" },     { name: ""John"", email: ""john@pathify.com"" },     { name: ""Mary"", email: ""mary@pathify.com"" } ];  return users.map(user => new code_data_SimpleData(user)); ```  **Important Points:**  - **Error Handling:**  Remember that JavaScript code can throw errors. It's good practice to include error handling within your `jsFunc` to prevent your Flow from failing. - **Data Consistency:** Ensure that your JavaScript code consistently returns the expected data types. Flow relies on this consistency for proper processing. - **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your `jsDataStreamCreator` to ensure it generates the data stream you need.  **In Summary:**  `jsDataStreamCreator` is a powerful tool for creating data streams in Flow. It gives you the flexibility of JavaScript, allowing you to generate custom data based on your specific requirements. Understanding how to use `jsDataStreamCreator` effectively is key to building dynamic and flexible Flows.",SOURCED,False,CHATBOT,[]

Prioritize the most important features for new users. * **Purposeful Text:** Use clear and concise titles and subtitles that guide users through the tour. * **Concise Slides:**  Keep the text on each slide brief and to the point. * **Role-Specific Tours:**  Consider creating separate onboarding tours for different user roles (e.g., faculty, students, staff). * **Mobile App Reminder:** Include a slide reminding users about the mobile app and how to download it. * **Call to Action:** End the tour with a clear call to action that directs users to a specific URL, such as:     * A task list     * A popular user group     * A portal user guide  **Design & Accessibility:**  * **Branding Consistency:**  Ensure the onboarding tour's design aligns with your institution's branding. * **Visual Appeal:**  Use images, videos, and clear formatting to make the tour engaging and easy to follow. * **Accessibility:**  Use color contrast and font sizes that are accessible to all users.  **Additional Tips:**  * **Review and Test:**  Thoroughly review the onboarding tour for accuracy and clarity. Test it with different user roles to ensure it is effective. * **Iterate and Improve:**  Gather feedback from users and make adjustments to the tour as needed.  **Remember:** The goal of the onboarding tour is to help new users feel comfortable and confident using the portal.

Gradually add more as you become comfortable with the system.  If assigning permissions to Non-portal Admins, start with minimal permissions and expand as needed.  * **Train Users:** Educate users on their assigned permissions and expectations.  * **Governance Sheet:** Create a document that tracks Roles, permissions, and associated responsibilities.  * **Consider Data Analysis:** When planning Roles, think about how they will be useful for filtering data for reports and analysis.",SOURCED,False,CHATBOT,[]

Chatbot Settings:**  This allows administrators to customize the chatbot's appearance (name, profile picture, branding colors), and default responses (opening message, generic response for when no relevant answer is found).  Access is typically through a designated admin panel.  **2. Chatbot Permissions:**  Administrators can control which user roles have access to the chatbot.  Changes to these permissions may take a few minutes to fully take effect.  **3. User Conversations:**  Administrators can review all user interactions with the chatbot, including ratings and feedback.  This section provides tools for sorting, searching, filtering, and downloading conversation data for analysis.  **4. Content:** This is where administrators manage how the chatbot sources and prioritizes information.  This includes:      * **Content Sources:** Enabling or disabling various portal sources (FAQs, Pages, Directory, etc.) that the chatbot uses to answer queries.  External search integration may require separate setup.     * **Relevance & Weights:**  Administrators can fine-tune the chatbot's responses by adjusting relevance thresholds (how closely content must match a user's query) and weights (prioritizing certain content categories like FAQs over Pages).  A real-time preview area allows testing adjustments before applying them live.  **5. Analytics:**  Administrators can track key metrics like total conversations, average messages per conversation, peak usage times, and user feedback.  Data can be filtered by role and date range, and exported for further analysis.   The exact navigation paths within the admin panel may vary, but generally involve navigating to a ""User Options,"" then ""Admin Center,"" then ""AI Chatbot"" section.
